@@ A new access token was created

Hi {{ account.name }},

We're writing to let you know that a new access token has been created for the "{{ repository.name }}" repository that you manage. Here are the details:

•  Name: {{ token.name }}
•  Description: {{ token.description ?: "None provided" }}
•  Expiration: {{ token.expires_at.toISOString() ?: "Never" }}

You can review your access tokens here:
{{ url('/repository', repository.id, 'settings/tokens') }}

Regards,
{{ env.APP_NAME }}

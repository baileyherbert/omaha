@@ A new collaborator invitation was created

Hi {{ account.name }},

We're writing to let you know that a new collaborator invitation has just been created for the "{{ repository.name }}" repository that you manage. The recipient will gain access to your repository with {{ invite.role }} privileges.

You can review your collaborators and pending invitations here:
{{ url('/repository', repository.id, 'settings/collaborators') }}

Thanks,
Omaha
